# Excel stock portfolio

<p>In this project I wanted to get more information about the stocks I had in my M1 finance account. I used my excel skills to make a portfolio and

## Questions

- **What is the total return on my portfolio?**
- **What is the yearly return?**
- **How many companies does the portfolio have?**
- **What is the amount invested?**
